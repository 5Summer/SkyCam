## CSEM-SkyCam

[paper] [project-page]

SkyCam dataset is a dataset of sky images from a variety of locations with diverse topological characteristics (Swiss Jura, Plateau and Pre-Alps regions), from both single and stereo camera settings coupled with a high-accuracy pyranometers. The dataset was collected with a high frequency with a data sample every 10 seconds. 13 images with different exposures times are generated along with a post-processed HDR images and a solar radiance values for each of the cameras and locations. We hope that SkyCam dataset will enable researchers to tackle the problem of short-term local camera-based solar radiance prediction.
